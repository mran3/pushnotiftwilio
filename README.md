# Two Factor Authentication with Twilio

This application leverages all the power of Twilio Verify and shows how to use Push Verification.

## Please have in mind:

- For this to work a backend is necessary. I set up one with the provided files in:

        https://tuilio.herokuapp.com/
        
- Initially I used Notify Quickstart project as a base, but then dismissed most of what was there as Verify works a little different.

- Push Notifications don't work on the simulator.
